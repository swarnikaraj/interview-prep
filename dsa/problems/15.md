845. Longest Mountain in Array
Medium

Companies
You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:

arr.length >= 3
There exists some index i (0-indexed) with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
Given an integer array arr, return the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain. Return 0 if there is no mountain subarray.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [2,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no mountain.



approach

✅ Finds peaks correctly
✅ Expands outward to count the full mountain
✅ Keeps track of the longest valid mountain
✅ Runs in O(n) time complexity (single pass with two expansions)


class Solution:
    def longestMountain(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
         n= len(arr)
         longest=0

         for i in range(1,len(arr)-1):

            if  arr[i-1] < arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
                left, right=i,i

                while left>0 and arr[left]>arr[left-1]:
                    left-=1

                while right<n-1 and arr[right]>arr[right+1]:
                    right+=1

                current_length= right-left + 1
                longest=max(longest,current_length)    

         return longest
