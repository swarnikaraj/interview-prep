Big 0 notation Timae and spcae complexity

Time complexity: describe the amount of time necesary to excute the code

Space Complexity: describe amount of memory of space utilized by an algo

both asymptotically

In CS , Big O is used to describe algo according to how fast they run or how much space they take as input size grows.

why? Big O notation helps understand how the performance of an algo changes  as the size of input grows. Provided simple way to compare and analyse diffent algo efficiently
